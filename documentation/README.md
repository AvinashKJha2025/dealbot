## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Notes

### Data Storage
- JSON-based storage for simplicity
- Separate files for deals, users, and subscriptions
- Easy to migrate to database in future

### Validation Rules
- User IDs: 4-character alphanumeric format
- Deal IDs: Positive integers
- Dates: YYYY-MM-DD format
- Pincodes: 5-digit format
- Amounts: $ prefix required

### Business Logic
- Deals filtered by user preferences (boolean flags)
- Location matching (state and pincode)
- Date range validation (current date between start/end)
- Subscription exclusion (don't show already subscribed deals)
